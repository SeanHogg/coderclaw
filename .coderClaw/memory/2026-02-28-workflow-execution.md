## Conversation Summary

assistant: I'll help you unblock the multi-agent system by wire up executeWorkflow(). Let me start by reading the key files to understand the current state.

Now let me understand the session context and how to access it from the tool:

Let me explore the actual codebase structure:

Now I need to understand how tools access the session context. Let me look at the sessions_spawn tool implementation:

Now let me find how tools are created and get their session context:

Let me check the workflow status tool as well:

Perfect! I now understand the architecture. Let me plan and implement Phase -1.1:

## Phase -1.1 Plan: Wire executeWorkflow()

**Problem**: The `orchestrate` tool creates a workflow but never calls `executeWorkflow()`. Workflows sit dormant in memory.

**Root cause**: `orchestrateTool` is a plain exported object without access to session context. It can't call `executeWorkflow()` because it lacks `SpawnSubagentContext`.

**Solution**:
1. Convert `orchestrateTool` from a plain object to a factory function `createOrchestrateTool(opts)` that captures session context (like `createSubagentsTool`)
2. After creating the workflow, immediately call `globalOrchestrator.executeWorkflow(workflowId, context)` in a fire-and-forget pattern
3. Update all registration sites to use the factory

Let me implement this:

Now update the tools index to export the factory:

Now update the coderclaw-tools registration to use the factory:

Now add orchestrate tool to the tools array with proper context:

Now let's run the tests to ensure everything compiles and works:

assistant: Let me assess the current state to determine if Phase -1.1 is already complete or needs implementation.
