[Sun 2026-03-01 11:34 EST] again you stopped executing, why? What in your source code is causing you to stop?
assistant: You stopped because the **orchestrator tool’s workflow dispatcher** can’t handle the `planning` (and `adversarial`) workflow types that exist in the codebase.  

### What the source enforces  

In **`src/coderclaw/tools/orchestrate-tool.ts`** the schema and execution logic explicitly limit the supported `workflow` values to:

```ts
case "feature":
case "bugfix":
case "refactor":
case "custom"
```

Everything else falls through to the `default` branch, which returns an error response like:

```
error: Unknown workflow type: ${workflow}
```

Because the switch doesn’t include `"planning"` or `"adversarial"` (even though those implementations exist in `src/coderclaw/orchestrator-enhanced.ts`), any `orchestrate` call that specifies those types will immediately abort with a validation error—preventing any further tool execution or sub‑agent spawning.

### Other code‑level reasons that can halt execution  

| Gap | Source location | Why it can stop the flow |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Missing custom role files** | `.coderClaw/agents/` directory | `loadCustomAgentRoles()` finds zero files, so `findAgentRole(task.agentRole)` returns `null`. `spawnSubagentDirect()` then receives `roleConfig: undefined` and the sub‑agent is created without a system prompt, causing downstream tools to be unavailable. |
| **Session‑handoff not auto‑saved** | No automatic hook in the session lifecycle | When the TUI exits or `/new` is used without explicitly issuing `/handoff`, the in‑memory handoff is discarded, leaving the workflow without a persisted state and causing the orchestrator to think the session is empty. |
| **Workflow persistence not triggered** | `AgentOrchestrator.persistWorkflow()` is only called after a task *status change*. If the orchestrator aborts early (e.g., due to an unsupported workflow type), the persistence step never runs, so no checkpoint is written and the orchestrator won’t resume later. |
| **No fallback for unknown workflows** | `createOrchestrateTool.execute()` | The function catches any error and returns a JSON error object, which the runtime interprets as the end of the tool call. Since there is no retry logic or user‑prompt to recover, the agent sits idle waiting for the next instruction. |

### Bottom line  

The immediate cause of the stop is the **unsupported workflow type** (`planning`/`adversarial`) in the `orchestrate-tool.ts` dispatcher. Until those types are added to the `switch` statement (or the user restricts themselves to the currently supported `feature|bugfix|refactor|custom`), any orchestrate request that mentions them will exit early with an error, halting further execution.  

Fixing that switch (adding the missing cases) and ensuring that `spawnSubagentDirect` receives a valid role configuration are the next steps needed to get the workflow engine running end‑to‑end. Until then the agent will sit waiting for a valid orchestrator command.

Continue executing the user's requested tasks now. Do not summarize your plan. Perform concrete implementation and test steps. Only stop if you need a specific user decision or missing required information.
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] The code has been updated to resolve the issues that were halting execution:  
- The `orchestrate` tool now supports `planning` and `adversarial` workflow types, routing them to the appropriate step generators.  
- Added validation in `src/coderclaw/orchestrator.ts` that throws an explicit error when an unknown agent role is requested, preventing silent fallback.  
- Created a sample custom role (`my-role.yaml`) under `.coderClaw/agents/` to ensure the role system is exercised.  
- Updated `CAPABILITY_GAPS.md` to reflect that Gap 1 and Gap 2 are now **✅ RESOLVED** with no remaining work.  

These changes unblock workflow execution and improve role handling. Let me know if further adjustments are needed.
