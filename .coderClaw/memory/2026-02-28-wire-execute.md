[Sat 2026-02-28 12:48 EST] You are working on the coderClaw platform itself — coderClaw building coderClaw. Read These First .coderClaw/planning/CAPABILITY_GAPS.md — START HERE: 6 gaps where code exists but is never called .coderClaw/planning/ROADMAP.md — local roadmap mirror (Phase -1 must be done before anything else) .coderClaw/context.yaml, .coderClaw/architecture.md — project metadata & module structure .coderClaw/planning/CLAW_REGISTRATION_ANALYSIS.md — local registration audit mirror (coderclawLLM API design) AGENTS.md — conventions (TS ESM, Vitest, Oxlint, Conventional Commits, ≤500 LOC/file) Canonical Source Paths (avoid ENOENT) src/coderclaw/tools/orchestrate-tool.ts src/coderclaw/orchestrator.ts src/agents/subagent-spawn.ts Do not use these non-existent paths: src/coderclaw/agents/subagent-spawn.ts src/coderclaw/tools/common.ts src/agents/agent-manager.ts Current State (facade — nothing executes) orchestrate tool creates workflows but never calls executeWorkflow() Agent roles defined but never applied to subagents Session handoff functions exist but have zero callers .coderClaw/ never updated after tasks complete Mesh (multi-claw orchestration) has zero implementation You cannot use multi-agent workflows yet. Work as a single agent. Per-Item Workflow For each roadmap item in one session: Plan — PRD + architecture spec + task breakdown Adversarial review — critique your own spec (security, perf, compatibility with ClawGateway/OTel/Vitest), then revise Implement — follow AGENTS.md rules Test — vitest, ≥70% coverage, no real network calls Review — AGENTS.md compliance check Commit — scripts/committer, Conventional Commits Update knowledge — note what changed, new gaps found, suggest next item Start: Phase -1.1 Wire executeWorkflow() into the orchestrate tool. This unblocks the entire multi-agent system. Read src/coderclaw/tools/orchestrate-tool.ts and src/coderclaw/orchestrator.ts, then plan. Constraints You're modifying your own source — don't break the agent runtime, gateway, or TUI scripts/committer per AGENTS.md, scoped commits No git stash or branch switching — other agents may be active pnpm vitest --run before committing ≤500 LOC per file After each item, update .coderClaw/planning/CAPABILITY_GAPS.md
assistant: I'll start by reading the essential planning files and the orchestrate tool code to understand what needs to be wired together.
assistant: Now let me read the current state of the orchestrator and the orchestrate tool more carefully. I notice the gap analysis says the tool doesn't call `executeWorkflow()`, but the code I just read shows it does. Let me verify with a fresh read focusing on that specific flow:
assistant: You're right to be confused. The gap analysis says orchestrate creates workflows but never executes them, yet the code clearly calls `executeWorkflow()`. 

Let me check the exact line numbers and understand what the gap analysis might be referring to. The gap says "line 96" but the file is shorter than that. Perhaps the gap analysis is outdated, or there's a different interpretation. Let me check if there might be multiple orchestrator tools or if the issue is actually something else like:

1. Does `spawnSubagentDirect` actually work?
2. Are roles being applied?
3. Is the workflow state persistent?

Let me examine the gap analysis more carefully and also check if there are tests for the orchestrate tool:
