[Sat 2026-02-28 13:00 EST] You are working on the coderClaw platform itself — coderClaw building coderClaw. Read These First .coderClaw/planning/CAPABILITY_GAPS.md — START HERE: 6 gaps where code exists but is never called .coderClaw/planning/ROADMAP.md — local roadmap mirror (Phase -1 must be done before anything else) .coderClaw/context.yaml, .coderClaw/architecture.md — project metadata & module structure .coderClaw/planning/CLAW_REGISTRATION_ANALYSIS.md — local registration audit mirror (coderclawLLM API design) AGENTS.md — conventions (TS ESM, Vitest, Oxlint, Conventional Commits, ≤500 LOC/file) Canonical Source Paths (avoid ENOENT) src/coderclaw/tools/orchestrate-tool.ts src/coderclaw/orchestrator.ts src/agents/subagent-spawn.ts Do not use these non-existent paths: src/coderclaw/agents/subagent-spawn.ts src/coderclaw/tools/common.ts src/agents/agent-manager.ts Current State (facade — nothing executes) orchestrate tool creates workflows but never calls executeWorkflow() Agent roles defined but never applied to subagents Session handoff functions exist but have zero callers .coderClaw/ never updated after tasks complete Mesh (multi-claw orchestration) has zero implementation You cannot use multi-agent workflows yet. Work as a single agent. Per-Item Workflow For each roadmap item in one session: Plan — PRD + architecture spec + task breakdown Adversarial review — critique your own spec (security, perf, compatibility with ClawGateway/OTel/Vitest), then revise Implement — follow AGENTS.md rules Test — vitest, ≥70% coverage, no real network calls Review — AGENTS.md compliance check Commit — scripts/committer, Conventional Commits Update knowledge — note what changed, new gaps found, suggest next item Start: Phase -1.1 Wire executeWorkflow() into the orchestrate tool. This unblocks the entire multi-agent system. Read src/coderclaw/tools/orchestrate-tool.ts and src/coderclaw/orchestrator.ts, then plan. Constraints You're modifying your own source — don't break the agent runtime, gateway, or TUI scripts/committer per AGENTS.md, scoped commits No git stash or branch switching — other agents may be active pnpm vitest --run before committing ≤500 LOC per file After each item, update .coderClaw/planning/CAPABILITY_GAPS.md
assistant: I'll start by understanding the current state and the gaps I need to address. Let me read the planning documents and the relevant source files.
assistant: Now let me read the source files to understand the current implementation:
assistant: I can see that the orchestrate tool **already calls** `executeWorkflow()` (lines 96-133), but the CAPABILITY_GAPS.md says it doesn't. This is interesting — either the fix was already applied, or the documentation is ahead of the code. Let me check the git history to understand the current state and also examine what `spawnSubagentDirect` expects for the agentId parameter:
assistant: Let me check the agent-roles.ts to understand how roles map to agent IDs:
assistant: Let me search for how agent IDs are resolved and whether role names map directly to agent IDs:
user: Continue executing the user's requested tasks now. Do not summarize your plan. Perform concrete implementation and test steps. Only stop if you need a specific user decision or missing required information.
