# CoderClaw Capability Gaps — Deep Audit

> Last updated: 2026-02-26
> Source: Code audit of `coderClaw/src/` and `coderClawLink/api/src/`

This document records what **actually works** vs. what is **facade code** (exists
but is never called) vs. what is **completely missing**. Every item here blocks
the self-improvement initiative where coderClaw builds itself using its own
agent features.

---

## Gap 1: Orchestrate Tool Creates But Never Executes Workflows

**Status**: IN PROGRESS — spawn stub implemented, test added

**Evidence**:
- `src/coderclaw/tools/orchestrate-tool.ts` line 96: calls
  `globalOrchestrator.createWorkflow(steps)` then returns
  `"Workflow created. It will execute asynchronously."`
- `executeWorkflow()` exists on `AgentOrchestrator` (line 130 of
  `orchestrator.ts`) and works correctly — DAG resolution, parallel dispatch,
  subagent spawning via `spawnSubagentDirect()`.
- **But nothing ever calls `executeWorkflow()`.** The tool lies — there is no
  background scheduler, no event loop pickup, no async executor.
- Workflows sit in an in-memory `Map<string, Workflow>` and are never touched
  again.

**Impact**: The entire multi-agent workflow system is inert. Planning, feature,
bugfix, refactor, and adversarial review workflows cannot run.

**Fix**: After `createWorkflow()`, immediately call `executeWorkflow(wf.id)`.
Wire the session's `SpawnSubagentContext` so spawned subagents have access to
tools. Add `planning` and `adversarial` workflow types (currently only
`feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `custom`). Tracked as **Phase -1.1**.

---

## Gap 2: Agent Roles Defined But Never Applied

**Status**: FACADE — code exists, never consumed

**Evidence**:
- `src/coderclaw/agent-roles.ts`: 7 role definitions with system prompts,
  models (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`), thinking levels, tool allowlists,
  and constraints.
- `findAgentRole(name)` is exported but **never imported anywhere** outside
  tests.
- `/agent <name>` TUI command switches gateway agent IDs — it does NOT look
  up role definitions or inject system prompts/tools/thinking from roles.
- `loadCustomAgentRoles()` in `project-context.ts` can read
  `.coderClaw/agents/*.yaml` — also never called.
- When the orchestrator spawns subagents for workflow steps, it does NOT
  apply role-specific system prompts, models, or tool restrictions.

**Impact**: Agents all behave identically regardless of role. The
`code-reviewer` has the same tools as `code-creator`. Role-specific constraints
(like refactor-agent's "never change public API without approval") are ignored.

**Fix**: Wire `findAgentRole()` into the subagent spawn path. Also call
`loadCustomAgentRoles()` so custom roles in `.coderClaw/agents/` work.
Tracked as **Phase -1.2**.

## Gap 3: Session Handoff Is Dead Code

**Status**: FACADE — fully implemented, zero callers

**Evidence**:
- `project-context.ts` lines 291-349: `saveSessionHandoff()`,
  `loadLatestSessionHandoff()`, `listSessionHandoffs()` — complete
  implementations with YAML serialization, sorted file listing, error handling.
- `SessionHandoff` type in `types.ts` lines 191-211: well-defined with
  `sessionId`, `timestamp`, `summary`, `decisions`, `nextSteps`,
  `openQuestions`, `artifacts`, `context`.
- `grep -r "saveSessionHandoff\|loadLatestSessionHandoff" --include="*.ts"`
  returns ONLY `project-context.ts` itself. **Zero imports. Zero callers.**
- No agent session startup code loads prior handoffs.
- No session teardown code saves handoffs.

**Impact**: Sessions have zero continuity. Every new session starts from
scratch. An agent cannot "resume from where we left off." Multi-session
roadmap work requires the human to manually re-explain context each time.

**Fix**: Save handoff on session end, load on session start, expose `/handoff`
TUI command. Tracked as **Phase -1.3**.

---

## Gap 4: Workflow State Is Ephemeral

**Status**: MISSING — no persistence at all

**Evidence**:
- `orchestrator.ts`: `private workflows = new Map<string, Workflow>()`
- Process restart = total state loss. No disk writes, no checkpoints.
- No `resumeWorkflow()` function exists.

**Impact**: Long-running workflows (multi-step feature implementation) cannot
survive TUI restart, network disconnection, or even an accidental Ctrl+C.

**Fix**: Serialize workflow state to `.coderClaw/sessions/workflow-{id}.yaml`
after each step. Add resume logic. Tracked as **Phase -1.4**.

---

## Gap 5: No Post-Task Knowledge Update

**Status**: MISSING — no automatic knowledge loop

**Evidence**:
- `.coderClaw/` is populated once by `coderclaw init` (interactive wizard).
- `architecture.md` is a skeleton created at init time, never refreshed.
- `.coderClaw/memory/` directory is created but **never indexed** by the
  memory system — only workspace-root `memory/` and `MEMORY.md` are watched
  by `manager-sync-ops.ts`.
- The **memory flush** hook (`memory-flush.ts`) fires pre-compaction only —
  it writes to workspace-root `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, not `.coderClaw/memory/`.
- `updateProjectContextFields()` exists but is only called during the
  interactive setup wizard, never after task completion.
- No post-task hook in the agent lifecycle.

**Impact**: coderClaw cannot learn from its own work. After implementing a
feature, the project context doesn't reflect the new modules. After discovering
a bug pattern, no rule is added. The knowledge base is write-once, never
updated.

**Fix**: Add post-task hook, bridge `.coderClaw/memory/` to indexing, add
`/knowledge update` command. Tracked as **Phase -1.5**.

---

## Gap 6: Mesh Is Branding, Not Implementation

**Status**: COMPLETELY MISSING — the core mesh concept has no code

**Evidence**:

### What "mesh" implies:
- Multiple coderClaw instances collaborating as a workforce
- Claw-to-claw task delegation (claw A asks claw B to do work)
- Distributed orchestration across claws
- Fleet discovery (which claws are online, what are their capabilities)

### What actually exists:
- **Hub-and-spoke relay**: `ClawRelayDO` connects ONE claw (upstream) to N
  browser clients. No claw-to-claw channel.
- **Local-only subagents**: `spawnSubagentDirect()` spawns in-process agents.
  There is no `RemoteSubagentAdapter` or similar.
- **No discovery**: A claw cannot query which other claws are online or what
  they can do. `coderclaw_instances` in the DB tracks registrations but no
  capability metadata or online status query API beyond the SPA.
- **No claw-to-claw routes**: No `/api/claws/:id/forward/:targetId` or
  equivalent. ClawRelayDO has no `forwardToUpstream` for a different DO.
- **No distributed task routing**: `ClawLinkTransportAdapter` submits tasks
  to the ClawLink server, but there's no concept of routing a task to a
  specific claw. The server is just a CRUD layer, not a router.

### What's partially there:
- `ClawLinkTransportAdapter` (295 lines): Full HTTP transport to ClawLink.
  Could be extended for claw-addressed routing if the server supported it.
- `coderclaw_instances` table: Tracks multiple claws per tenant with status
  fields. Could become the fleet registry with capability metadata.
- `RuntimeStatus.mode` type includes `"distributed-cluster"` (never used).

**Impact**: The platform cannot distribute work. All computation happens on one
machine. A "fleet" of claws is just a list in a database — they can't
collaborate.

**Fix**: Build claw discovery API, claw-to-claw relay extension to
ClawRelayDO, `RemoteSubagentAdapter`, orchestrator mesh mode. Tracked as
**Phase -1.6** (foundation) and **Phase 4** (full orchestration).

## Priority Order

| Priority | Gap | Why first |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | **-1.1** Wire executeWorkflow | Nothing works without this — it's the core engine |
| 2 | **-1.2** Wire agent roles | Workflows need role-specific behavior to be useful |
| 3 | **-1.3** Wire session handoff | Multi-session work needs continuity |
| 4 | **-1.5** Knowledge loop | Agents need updated context to work effectively |
| 5 | **-1.4** Workflow persistence | Nice-to-have once workflows actually run |
| 6 | **-1.6** Mesh plumbing | Enables Phase 4/5 but single-claw works fine for now |

Items 1-4 are **blocking**: coderClaw literally cannot self-improve without them.
Items 5-6 are **enabling**: they improve reliability and scale but aren't required
for the single-claw self-bootstrapping loop.

## Verification Checklist

After each gap is fixed, verify:

- [ ] **-1.1**: `> orchestrate feature "add a hello world function"` → subagents
  spawn, code is created, tested, and reviewed. Workflow reaches `completed`.
- [ ] **-1.2**: Spawned subagents use role-specific system prompts and tool sets.
  `code-reviewer` cannot use `create` tool. `refactor-agent` has explicit
  constraint about public APIs.
- [ ] **-1.3**: Start session → do work → exit. Start new session → see
  "Resuming from: [summary]" → prior decisions and next steps in context.
- [ ] **-1.4**: Start workflow → kill process mid-step → restart → see
  "Incomplete workflow found. Resume? [Y/n]" → continues from last checkpoint.
- [ ] **-1.5**: Complete a task that adds a new module → `architecture.md` is
  updated → next agent session sees the new module in its context.
- [ ] **-1.6**: `GET /api/tenants/:id/claws?status=online` returns online claws
  with capabilities. Orchestrator can dispatch a step to a remote claw.
