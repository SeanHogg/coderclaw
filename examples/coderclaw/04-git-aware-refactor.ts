 * - Analyze commit history
 * - Identify frequently changed files
 * - Track authorship and evolution

  console.log(`
Repository Analysis:
  Total commits: 1,247
  Unique authors: 8
  Date range: 2024-01-15 to 2026-02-19
  
Hot Spots (most changed files):
  1. src/agents/pi-tools.ts - 47 commits
  2. src/coderclaw/orchestrator.ts - 31 commits
  3. src/transport/runtime.ts - 28 commits
  
Refactoring Recommendations:
  ⚠ High churn detected in pi-tools.ts
    → Consider breaking into smaller modules
    → 5 different authors modified this file
    → 47 commits in 90 days suggests instability
    
  ✓ Stable modules:
    - src/coderclaw/types.ts (3 commits, well-defined)
    - src/security/types.ts (5 commits, stable interface)
    
Coupling Analysis:
  Files often changed together:
    - pi-tools.ts ↔ pi-embedded-runner.ts (23 co-commits)
    → Suggests strong coupling, consider refactoring
    
Architecture Evolution:
  Phase 1: Local-only execution (commits 1-500)
  Phase 2: Distributed runtime added (commits 501-900)
  Current: Multi-agent orchestration (commits 901+)
